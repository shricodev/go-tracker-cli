## Go Tracker CLI

Go Tracker CLI is a command-line interface application designed to manage personal tasks or trackers.
With this tool, you can easily add, mark as completed, delete, and list your tasks directly from the terminal.

### Features

- **Add Trackers**: Quickly add new tasks to your list with a single command.
- **Complete Trackers**: Mark tasks as completed and track your progress efficiently.
- **Delete Trackers**: Remove tasks from your list when they are no longer needed.
- **List Trackers**: View all your active tasks in a neat table format.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are saved in a JSON file, ensuring they persist across sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Command-line interactions are straightforward and intuitive.

> üçé **NOTE**: As I have now completely moved into CLI. Most of my applications are in the CLI itself. This is just my way of replacing Microsoft Tracker. Just a small tracker CLI app, nothing **fancy**.
